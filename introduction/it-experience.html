                    <h2>Technical Skills & Experience</h2>

                    <h3>Programming Languages</h3>
                    <p>I have strong proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which form the foundation of my web development skills. Additionally, I'm experienced with Python for backend development and data analysis, and I'm currently expanding my knowledge of TypeScript for more robust application development.</p>

                    <h3>Web Development</h3>
                    <p>My web development experience includes building responsive websites from scratch using modern HTML5 and CSS3 techniques. I'm skilled in creating interactive user interfaces with vanilla JavaScript and have worked with popular frameworks like React. I understand the importance of accessibility, SEO, and web performance optimization.</p>

                    <h3>Tools & Technologies</h3>
                    <p>I'm comfortable using version control systems like Git and GitHub for collaborative development. I have experience with development tools including VS Code, Chrome DevTools, and various testing frameworks. I'm also familiar with package managers like npm and build tools like Webpack and Vite.</p>

                    <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
                    <p>During my internship at a local tech startup, I contributed to the development of a customer-facing web application. I collaborated with designers to implement pixel-perfect UI components and worked closely with backend developers to integrate RESTful APIs. This experience taught me the importance of clean code, documentation, and teamwork.</p>

                    <h3>Projects & Portfolio</h3>
                    <p>I've completed several personal projects including an e-commerce website, a task management application, and a portfolio site. Each project has helped me deepen my understanding of web technologies and best practices. I'm constantly working on new projects to challenge myself and learn emerging technologies.</p>

                    <h3>Continuous Learning</h3>
                    <p>The tech field is always evolving, and I'm committed to staying current with the latest trends and technologies. I regularly take online courses, attend webinars, read technical blogs, and participate in coding communities. I believe that continuous learning is essential for growth in the IT industry.</p>

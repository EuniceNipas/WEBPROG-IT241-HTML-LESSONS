  <h2>Goals & Dreams</h2>
  <p>I want to be rich in life, but not in the luxurious sense; I want to<br>
    be rich in the sense that I can be happy in what is most important to me:<br> 
    healthy connections with friends, family, and a partner.<br>
    What most others consider to be basic,<br>
    I see as something very remarkable. .</p>

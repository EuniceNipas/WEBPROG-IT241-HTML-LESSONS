<h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
            <p>Hi, my name is Eunice B. Nipas, although most people just call me Nissy. Fun fact: I came up with that name as an internet alias during the epidemic, but I eventually came to love it and adopted it as my actual nickname. </p>
            <p>The best year for me was 2006 because that was the year I was born. I dislike most vegetables, but I do enjoy a good Caesar salad! I LOVE STYLING; ou can always see me having different hair color here and there and even style of clothing. And if I had the opportunity to be an animal, I would select a cat since I adore them and believe their life cycle is simple: eat, sleep, litter, and repeat. </p>
            <p>Feel free to explore the different sections to learn more about my hobbies, education, goals, and IT experience. Thank you for visiting!</p>
